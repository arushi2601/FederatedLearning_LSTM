Federated Learning using LSTM networks in Healthcare

Federated learning is a machine learning model that acts as a method to train algorithms on decentralized data where sharing the raw data is prohibited due to security concerns. Multiple applications in the healthcare domain like Electronic Health Records (EHR) consisting of critical patient data can be shared to various authorities safely through the use of FL training algorithms. In this model, an MNIST framework is used as a dataset and is trained using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is wellsuited to model temporal data with long-range dependencies, which is suitable for transfering data in the healthcare domain as well. 
Experimental observation indicates that a trained model using LSTM achieves a higher global global accuracy(0.91247) as compared to the baseline model with the same dataset (0.8041).
